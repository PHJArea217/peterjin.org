<div id="subheader">About Me</div>
<p>My name is Peter H. Jin, and
I am currently a UIUC student studying computer engineering. My main interests are science, web design, system administration, and general computer programming, although I may acquire more.
</p>
<p>The name "Area217" derives from the telephonic
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_217">area code "217"</a> of Champaign-Urbana, the principal location of UIUC (go figure).</p>
<p>I speak German, Chinese, and a little bit of French, however, they are currently only at a high school level.</p>
<p>The profile picture that I commonly use online is an <a href="13477417.png">image</a> of Moraine Lake, in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada.
To distinguish this profile picture with lookalikes, note the six trees with the center tree being the largest, the lake appearing completely opaque, and the overexposed top-right sky.</p>
