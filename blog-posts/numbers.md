2018-10-07|2|-|-|Phone Numbers

Here is a list of various phone numbers that I've found on the Internet. Some of
them are within the US, some are international. All these numbers are automated
phone lines of various automated services, most commonly speaking clocks, so
they do not accept voice input. So take out your phone, dial these numbers,
and listen to the goodness.

The numbers are sorted by numeric value. You can simply tap on the number \(on
supported mobile browsers) to call it.

**Warning**: Call at your own risk. I am not responsible for any mishaps or
accidental or intentional voice transmission that may occur when calling these
numbers. If possible, mute the microphone. Calls to international numbers may
incur additional charges. I cannot guarantee that these numbers are actually the
services described, or that the information provided by these services are
accurate. Oftentimes, the number may be reassigned to a completely unrelated
subscriber. In addition, I do not necessarily endorse or recommend any of these
phone services for any critical purposes.
